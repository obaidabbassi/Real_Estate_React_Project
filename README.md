## Real Estate Project
Welcome to the Real Estate Project! This is a front-end application built using React that allows users to explore houses and properties available for purchase or rent. The project uses Axios to fetch random property images and Bootstrap for the user interface. In the future, the front-end will be connected to a Spring Boot back-end and utilize MySQL for data storage.
